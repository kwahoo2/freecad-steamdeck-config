Configuration files to run FreeCAD on Steam Deck as shown in this video: https://youtu.be/mDA-RJvtl3M

Download FreeCAD Link from https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases

Rename it from FreeCAD-asm3***.Appimage to freecad

Run 'freecad' in the desktop mode to check if everything works ok.

Add 'freecad' as non-steam game. Copy files from the repository to relevant directories.

Go to the gaming mode and run FreeCAD. The controller configuration should be seen as 'FreeCAD CAD Navigation'
